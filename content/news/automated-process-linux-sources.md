*OpenELA provides a comprehensive resource for ISVs, IHVs, processor manufacturers, and independent developers building downstream enterprise Linux distributions, with sources available within a few days of RHEL releases*

**RENO, Nev., AUSTIN, Texas, and LUXEMBOURG—July 12, 2024—** The Open Enterprise Linux Association ([OpenELA](https://openela.org/about/)) has launched an automated process to make new enterprise Linux sources available just days after each release of new versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Packages for the most recent such releases —RHEL 9.4 and RHEL 8.10—are now available at https://github.com/orgs/openela-main/repositories.

OpenELA’s rapid response demonstrates the utility of the organization as a resource for independent software vendors (ISVs), independent hardware vendors (IHVs), processor manufacturers, independent developers, and others who need rapid, reliable, and secure access to enterprise Linux sources to create their downstream builds.

“Anyone interested in creating a downstream build can access the OpenELA repositories to access the sources they need,” said Gregory Kurtzer, CEO, CIQ and a founding member of OpenELA. “Since we don’t create the actual build and simply provide reliable access to the sources, we can move quickly and empower the entire open source ecosystem to accelerate the development and delivery of their enterprise Linux builds.”

“If you create a downstream build, we welcome you to join OpenELA,” said Alan Clark, member of the office of the CTO, SUSE and a founding member of OpenELA. “The ability of OpenELA to move quickly in providing the sources to these releases illustrates to the open source community that now, with OpenELA, access to enterprise Linux sources is reliably available. This is central to the OpenELA mission: sharing with the world that these open source components are here for the taking, as they should be.”

“OpenELA has automated the downstream distribution build process to help users leverage the benefits of the latest versions of enterprise Linux as efficiently as possible,” said Wim Coekaerts, executive vice president, software development, Oracle and a founding member of OpenELA. “By making high quality source code easily accessible to the enterprise Linux community, OpenELA enables organizations and individuals to streamline the creation of their builds, while gaining the peace of mind that the code is delivered by a reliable and secure source.”
